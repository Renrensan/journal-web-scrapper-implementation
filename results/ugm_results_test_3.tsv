  Aktivisme dan Kesukarelawanan dalam Media Sosial Komunitas Kaum Muda Yogyakarta   	Ramma Wisnu Dewantara, Derajat S. Widhyharto	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/10855/pdf	Aktivisme dan kesukarelawanan kaum muda dalam membentuk gerakan sosial telah mengalami pergeseran dari offline menuju online. Hal ini tidak terlepas dari perkembangan teknologi informasi terutama dengan munculnya Web 2.0 yang membuat banyak realitas sosial diperlihatkan oleh media baru tersebut. Salah satu turunan media baru ini adalah media sosial yang dianggap unggul dalam kecepatan mendistribusikan pesan. Media sosial juga menjadi “ruang publik baru”kaum muda untuk berbagi atau berdiskusi mengenai isu tertentu, bahkan sampai digunakan sebagai tuntutan revolusi. Metode yang digunakan dalam penelitian media baru ini adalah wawancara mendalam dan focus group discussion. Temuannya memperlihatkan bahwa kaum muda Yogyakarta, yang terhimpun dalam berbagai komunitas, berhasil memanfaatkan media sosial sebagai penyeimbang, pengingat, dan suplemen gerakan baru komunitas kaum muda.
  Silent Political Apathy in Urban Society: The Case of Medan 2018 Election   	Derajad Sulistyo Widhyharto, Desi Rahmawati, Norin Mustika Rahadiri Abheseka	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/51724/pdf	Studies on non-voting behavior and which depart from social perspectives have long been stagnated due to the dominance of analysis that puts systems, institutionalization, political mechanisms and participation as the main viewpoints of the studies. This study using social perspectives is useful to explain why voters were not present at polling stations during the Medan 2018 Election. It elaborates the social aspects that influenced non-voting behavior in the urban area of Medan in North Sumatra, Indonesia during the 2018 gubernatorial election. Utilizing mix- method strategies, instead of citing social aspects as a mere research context, this article argues that social aspects in the form of social cleavages worked behind the silent apathy, namely apathy that was implicitly indicated by voters who were not present at polling stations. Social cleavages including ethnicity, religion and gender indicated a paradox since they—with the exception of gender—were used by candidates as the main campaign substance. On the other hand, large numbers of people showed disinterest in these social cleavages during the election. This article explains why abstained voters hid their disinterest behind their excuses for not being present at the polling stations for economic (working activities) and other reasons.
  Masyarakat Adat versus Korporasi: Konflik Sosial Rencana Pembangunan Pabrik Semen di Kabupaten Pati Jawa Tengah Periode 2013-2016   	Suharko Suharko	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/24776/16027	Social confilct between indigenous community of Sedulur Sikep and PT SMS has arisen as a consequence of utilization of karst for cement plant in District of Pati, Central Java since 2010. Using secondary data collected from off line and on line media, and applying Wehr's model of conflict mapping, the article aims to map the conflict. For the corporation, karst can be mined and has a high economic value. For Sedulur Sikep, karst must be concerved because it covers water reservoir that is vital for its agricultural livelihood. From 2010 to 2014, while Sedulur Sikep continuesly rejected the establishment of the plant, PT SMS had completed environmental impact analysis. After Head of Pati district launched an environmental licence for PT SMS in the end of 2014, the two parties of conflict had been head to head in two levels of the administrative courts (PTUN Semarang and PTTUN Surabaya). The verdicts of court are not able to end the conflict yet. Opportunity to solve the conflict will depend on the results of strategic environmental analysis (KLHS) that was decided by the President as a reference for parties who plan to mine karst in mountain of Kendeng Utara, Central Java
  Krisis Kapitalisme 2008 dan Bangkitnya Gerakan Kiri Studi Dinamika Gerakan Partai Syriza di Yunani   	Arif Novianto, Lukman Kurniawan, Samodra Wibawa	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/15678/10445	The economic crisis which hit Greece was in 2008 helped to flow into a political crisis. The old political oligarchy that since 1974 up to 2010 alternately dominate the Greece that is PASOK party and the New Democracy party suffered shocks that lead to new political dynamics. Austerity policies and neoliberal reforms under the moderation of the troika (Europaen Central Bank, European Union, and International Monetary Fund) have created a decrease in the level of welfare and the economic crisis are instead growing. That situation creates a distrust of the Greek people, until they are searching for an alternative system other than capitalism. At that time the idea of socialism promoted by Syriza party has been able to to gain influence in the mass base, to deliver Syriza-led government with 36.3 percent of voters in Election 2015. This paper attempts to elaborate on the strategies used by the Syriza party and also weaknesses in the startegy
  Tanggung jawab Sosial Korporasi dan Hak-Hak Masyarakat Hukum Adat   	- Afrizal	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/10882/8123	This article scrutinizes the implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) concept on the recognition of indigenous society’s rights over agrarian resources. It is argued that the concept is relevant to study forms of social relation between corporations and indigenous societies. Publication about that is little. Indigenous societies across Indonesia insist that they have rights over agrarian sources within their customary territory and the rights are recognized by the Indonesian state as well as international bodies. Academicians only pay attention to the government’s responsibility to recognize and respect the indigenous society’s rights. It is contended that from the concept of CSR a corporation is responsible for recognizing and respecting indigenous societies’ rights over agrarian sources, but this article demonstrates that realization of indigenous community’s rights by corporations is dependent upon pressure from indigenous communities rather than coporations’ initiative.
  Karst: Ditambang atau Dilestarikan, Konflik Sosial Rencana Pembangunan Pabrik Semen di Kabupaten Pati Jawa Tengah   	- Suharko	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/10881/8122	The establishment of cement industry at regions with rich content of karst has increasingly grown in recent years. As a consequence, conflict of interest between cement company and local people groups has arised. The article aims to mapping out a natural resource based-conflict in district of Pati, province of Jawa Tengah.

Through organizing indigenous people, building social networks, and undertaking various collective actions, the local people groups have refused any efforts for establishing the plant. While this social conflict has continued, so far there is no an adequate conflict resolution. However, the new government of Central Java resulted from the 2013 election provides an opportunity to end the conflict.

  The Unemployment Rate Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: Propose the Best Practices Policy to Maintain Labor Market Stability   	Nazaruddin Malik, Muhammad Sri Wahyudi Suliswanto, Mochamad Rofik	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/56450/pdf	This study analyzes the impact of the shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the labor market. The research is vital for expanding the literature about maintaining the unemployment rate amid crisis, ultimately reducing unnecessary social costs. The quantitative approach in this study uses a Granger causality test to understand the effect of the shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment. Meanwhile, the qualitative approach in this study uses literature related to economic growth, crisis management, and unemployment. Granger causality tests show that economic slowdown hurts the unemployment rate. Based on discussion and synthesis from works of literature, this paper recommends some of the policies to maintain growth and prevent a more severe collapse in the labor market; the government needs to sustain aggregate demand and supply. Also, ensure the supply chain runs well amid various restrictions. Besides, this paper also proposes that the government maximizes alternative budget resources. Meanwhile, strengthening the labor system and developing health and food security industries must be a priority policy amid-post the pandemic.
  Aging Labor and Japanese Industry Performance: Lessons for Indonesia Policies   	Indri Dwi Apriliyanti	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/31754/pdf	This study analyzes the labor input factor that determines and shapes output generation in Japan. It hypothesizes that labor input contributes to the development of output growth in Japanese industries. In addition to that, it is hypothesized that moderator variable which is represented by numbers of aging labor can either stimulate or weaken the output generation. Hypotheses are tested using the data obtained from the Research Institute of Economy, Trade, and Industry (RIETI) Japan Industrial Output (JIP) Database 2011 and Japan Statistics Oﬃcial within period 1970 to 2008. A multiple regression analysis, a manova and a hierarchical multiple regression analysis are conducted. Similar to expectation, aging labor has a negative moderating eﬀect on labor-intensive industry; meanwhile aging labor has a positive moderating eﬀect on capital-intensive industry. Not only does this study provide thorough knowledge towards output generation in Japan, but it also provides substantial lessons for Indonesia, particularly to enhance the industrial policy regarding the aging labor.
  Perjuangan Gerakan Buruh Tidak Sekedar Upah Melacak Perkembangan Isu Gerakan Buruh di Indonesia Pasca Reformasi   	Muhammad Zuhdan	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/13086/9315	The purpose of this paper is to track issues championed by the labor movement aft er the reform. The ﬁ rst thesis of this paper behold issue championed labor movement is not merely a matt er of wage increases. This paper focus on championed issue by the labor movement in the post-reformation Indonesia. The reasons for selecting this theme is to expand the public’s view on the issue of labor which has always been synonymous with wage when the labor movement has long roots and a tradition of thought that labor issues are always  dialectical and dynamic with the changing socio-political structure. The results of this study indicate that the issue of the labor movement in the post-reformation Indonesia no longer dwell on the issue of wage increase alone but develops progressively in the direction of political issues that is identical to the New Left movement, ranging from labor issues Go Politics, anti-neoliberalism, gender, human rights, democracy,citizenship, public policy, etc.
  (Gerakan Sosial (Baru) Pasca “Orde Baru”) Gerakan Buruh Pasca Soeharto: Politik Jalanan di Tengah Himpitan Pasar Kerja Fleksibel   	Muhtar Habibi	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/10903/8144	Labor movement after Soeharto shows different trend compare to the many view of the observers before. In the midst of the crush of neoliberal labor market flexibility, workers still often performs various street protests. The rising of minimum wage and changes in employment status towards more profitable one, are some workers material benefits gained through their street protest. Moreover, street protest also contributes to the making of collective workers identity. The high intensity of the street actions spawned the backlash from the capital and state. However, this attack rather than weaken the labor movement, instead it has the potential to encourage greater unity needs of the workers. The backlash from the capital and state during growing economic circumstances provide momentum to the emerging needs of modern interest organizations: a labor’ party. The future of the establishment labor’ party will depend on how much effort of the progressive elements in trade union able to leverage on the one hand a growing economy condition, and at the same time politically able to use reprisals of state and capital against their movement to create the need for the formation of an independent labor party for the rank and file workers.
  Power Imbalances in Collective Decision-Making: The Study of Minimum Wage Setting Cases   	Elisa Susanti, Heru Nurasa, Ida Widianingsih	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/35997/pdf	This paper aimed to empirically describe the power imbalances issues in setting the minimum wage in Bandung Regency and West Bandung Regency. Formally, Regional Wage Council has been established based on equality. However, several power imbalances have occurred within it. This paper also aimed to figure out the way to balance the power in collective decision making in the case of minimum wage setting. Furthermore, the research method used in this research was based on qualitative approach. Also, informants in this research were members of Regional Wage Council, employers in the industrial sector, and trade unions/labor unions in Bandung Regency and West Bandung Regency. The results of this study showed that power imbalances empirically existed in the setting of minimum wage. These imbalances were due to the issues of representatives, the number of members, information resources, and uncertainty. Moreover, power imbalances in the setting of minimum wage have led to the government’s more dominant role. Under these conditions, the effort required to overcome the problem of imbalance is by increasing trust in the government and the commitment of each party to the rules and collective agreements.
  Mobilitas Pekerja, Remitan dan Peluang Berusaha di Pedesaan   	Tadjudin Nur Effendi	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/11054/8295	The impact of labor mobility on rural development has received considerable attention from scholars and planner. On the one hand, some scholars and urban planners believe that labor mobility has negative effects on rural development partly it result in a cause lack of human resources to support regional development activities. In addition, they believe that rural-urban migration has created problems, such as unemployment, the spread of informal activities, poverty, and other social problems. On the other hand, they argue that labor mobility has positive effects on rural development. Labor mobility has been seen as a household survival strategy in response to the socio-economic change resulting from inequality of the market expansion. By involving in the urban labor market, especially in informal activities, migrants are able to share the fruits of development which tend to be concentrated in particular regions (urban areas). Some scholars believe that remittances sent by migrants to their places of origin may stimulate the growth of business activities in these areas. By examining some empirical studies, this article discusses the impact of labor mobility on business opportunities in areas of out-migration.
  Indonesian Migrant Workers in Taiwan: The State Dilemma and People’s Realities   	Ali Maksum, Ching-lung Tsay, Ali Muhammad	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/51303/pdf	The role of migrant workers is frequently marginalized amid industrial development, labor shortages, and the domination of state to state arrangements. In fact, the position of migrant workers should be considered as a primary factor in bilateral relations and trade agreements, notably between Indonesia and Taiwan. The reason is that the influx of migrant workers has undoubtedly given many benefits to both Indonesia and Taiwan governments. The Indonesian government considered that in the midst of insufficient job opportunities, migrant workers working in Taiwan indirectly lowered the unemployment rate. In addition, Indonesia acknowledged the high contribution of migrant workers by remittances to national income. At the same time, Taiwan recognized the importance of Indonesian migrant workers in the national economy, as well as strengthening Taiwan’s second-track diplomacy with Indonesia vis-à-vis China. This article argues the dynamics of Indonesian migrant workers in Taiwan, influenced by two factors: (1) the state dilemma and (2) people’s realities, affecting the international relations between Indonesia and Taiwan. Therefore, this paper aims to explore possible answers by discussing the state dilemma and peoples’ realities from the perspective of Indonesian workers in Taiwan. This study represents qualitative research supplemented by data obtained from interviews with Indonesian workers in Taiwan. The authors are also intensively contacted and involved through activities with Indonesian workers and communities.

  Ekonomi Politik Perminyakan Indonesia: Analisis Kebijakan Liberalisasi Sektor Hulu Migas Indonesia pasca-1998   	Ahmad Rizky Mardhatillah Umar	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/10911/8152	In the early of 2012, The Government of Indonesia launched a policy proposal remove fuel price subsidy and raise its price up to Rp 6.000. This proposal was followed by mass protests from student, labor, and civil society movement in many provinces. These protest, which was supported by opposition party in parliament (PDIP, Gerindra, and Hanura), ended up with a political compromy at the House of Representative plenary session: The government has opportunity to adjust fuel prices with ‘international oil price’ of Indonesian Crude Price (ICP) rises or falls around 15% in 6 months. Why do the fuel pricing scheme become very dependent with international oil price which is very oligopolistic (Berger dkk, 1988)? Is it a part of the oligarchy consolidation in Indonesia (Robison dkk, 2004)? This paper will try to answer this question by analyzing the political economy of Post-1998 Indonesian oil sector management.
  Poverty and Digital Divide: A Study in Urban Poor Neighborhoods   	Tri Mulyaningsih, Rutiana Wahyunengseh, Sri Hastjarjo	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/52325/pdf	Literature suggests that the penetration of digital technology may create a digital divide, particularly for groups that lack resources and the capacity to access technology. This study is keen to examine the poverty and digital divide, particularly in urban poor areas. There are two research objectives. Firstly, to examine the digital diffusion and digital literacy within poor urban neighborhoods in the City of Magelang, Central Java, Indonesia. Secondly, to understand the variation of digital diffusion and digital literacy across areas (with different levels of poverty), age groups, genders and occupations. The data is collected from surveys focused on measuring the access to information, digital diffusion and the use of technology among the poor. This study found that there is a digital divide problem among people in urban areas, especially among people with low incomes. Moreover, the diffusion is dominated by certain groups such as younger people and females. Furthermore, digital literacy among the poor is low. The policy implication is to improve access for digital diffusion and provide assistance to improve digital literacy skills.
  Voters (Dis)-Believing Digital Political Disinformation in Gubernatorial Election of DKI Jakarta 2016-2017   	Gilang Desti Parahita	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/33736/pdf	Some studies, with regards to the salience of digital disinformation, have focused on investigating the tendency to believe disinformation by looking at a single cluster of factors. This study reveals factors ranging from multiple clusters, such as socioeconomic status, political partisanship, diversity of media exposure, trust in the media, and the digital fluency of the voters. The Gubernatorial Election of DKI Jakarta during 2016-2017 provided a context for examining the correlation between these factors and the (dis)-belief of digital political disinformation among the voters. In the election, the incumbent governor, Basuki Tjahja Purnama, was falsely accused of being a communist, which is still a dirty word in Indonesia, by his opponent. A survey was conducted for this research, collecting completed questionnaires from 191 citizens of DKI Jakarta who had voting rights and could access the online and digital disinformation. The null hypothesis was that socioeconomic status, political partisanship, diversity of media exposure, trust in the media and digital fluency did not influence the citizens’ perceptions towards digital political information. However, the regression analysis found that the null hypothesis should be rejected. Of those predictors, political partisanship had the highest significant correlation with those perceptions.
  Twitter Based Digital Social Movement Pattern to Fight COVID-19   	Mohammad Thoriq Bahri, Derajad Sulistyo Widhyharto	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/56872/pdf	Twitter has become a tool for people to trigger a social change, like what is happening right now during COVID-19 outbreaks. Most people are using social media platforms to express their perspectives. For the first time, this research aimed to analyze the pattern of a social movement that happened during COVID-19 Outbreaks by analyzing the Twitter dataset contains 23,476 tweets worldwide with the #COVID19 hashtag which was obtained from 02 March to 09 April 2020. Social Network Analysis tools are used to understand the pattern of movement. This research concluded that if the Government and Mainstream Media Twitter account triggered the conversation in the social media platform, followed by the activists and celebrities who engage in conversation between their followers, an ordinary person spread the point of view of the Government and Mainstream Media across their conversation network. The COVID-19 hashtag successfully engaged 10 protest clusters, which pushed the people to fight against COVID-19 in their countries, mostly targeting the government-related account. The digital social movement pattern is relatively different from the traditional social movement, even it has the same steps, which emerge, coalesce, bureaucratise, and the movement itself, but it takes place in the Digital Public Sphere without any social or political boundaries. The digital social movement forced the government to implement a better policy to fight the COVID-19 Pandemic, including to close the national border to prevent unnecessary effects of International Migration.
  Understanding New Consumption Sites of Internet Cafe in Yogyakarta, Indonesia   	Tangguh Okta Wibowo, Wening Udasmoro, Ratna Noviani	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/51707/pdf	In the Indonesian context, we did not find any previous study on internet cafes that discussed the transformation from warnet to internet cafe. Based on our study in Yogyakarta, we found a new internet cafe style that we did not find in other cities. This study offers a new understanding of analyzing internet cafes that users not only consume a computer to access the internet, but they “consume” space as well. This study aims to explore that transformation and to reveal the expansion of consumption patterns. This study emphasizes the empirical investigation to gather the data. We conducted qualitative in-depth interviews and observations from January to June 2018. We also examined several previous studies about internet cafes to expose a gap that can be extended in this study. Based on findings, we found that the transformation from warnet was a way to survive amid mobile technology. This transformation gives an implication to the new means of consumption. However, the expansion of consumption patterns can be explored from the consumption of space and digital content. Overall, digital content is the new insight to understand that internet cafes are not only a place to copy contents, but this can be seen as a symbol of empowerment to local users. Therefore, internet cafes can be seen as media-industry bottom lines to promote a culture of resistance to digital content without going to the store or going to the cinema.
  Persecution Act as Filter Bubble Effect: Digital Society and The Shift of Public Sphere   	Arina Rohmatul Hidayah	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/33244/pdf	This article discusses persecution acts associated with the filter bubble effect, the condition of digital society, the concept of the public sphere and the rational action theory of Jurgen Habermas. The results, obtained through the literature research method, show that acts of persecution in social media can be caused by the personalization of the web. Social media allows the occurrence of large bubbles (filter bubbles) that make users reject ideologies or other truths. This becomes a revolution of mindset due to the freedom of information. Meanwhile, in the Habermas public sphere concept, which emphasizes the existence of a critical and rational discussion, this phenomenon indicates a shift. The shift that occurs brings about the lifeworld realm as the basis for the formation of the public sphere with its communicative action, again dominated by the system realm that is dominated by capitalist forces through strategic action. Thus, Habermas's initial goal of strengthening civil society's position against the dominance of the system is now changing.
  Millennials’ Contribution in Disaster Risk Reduction: Case Study of Tidal Flooding in Semarang   	Theresia Octastefani, Muhammad Rum	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/43727/pdf	This research focuses on the contribution of young millennials in reducing the risk of tidal flooding along the northern coast of Semarang. Young millennials have received special attention in disaster management, and the study of digital transformations in disaster management has become more significant. The objective of this study is to examine how smart disaster responses to natural disasters, specifically the case of tidal flooding in three districts of the city (North Semarang, Genuk, and Tugu) and a district nearby Demak Regency (Sayung). To obtain comprehensive results, this research uses qualitative methods, which data collected through in-depth interviews; Focus Groups Discussion (FGD); observations; and desk studies. This study finds that Millennials’ involvement is very important due to their distance from political interests and innovatively able to offer strategies in reducing the problems caused by tidal floods. The involvement of millennials in disaster management is relevant, given that Semarang will soon enjoy the demographic bonus, i.e. have a significant percentage of its population of productive age. Lastly, this research argues that vibrant public participation in disaster management can only be possible under democratic circumstances. As the implication, the study on public active participation might help disaster risk reduction campaign.
  Analysis of the E-Government Initiative at Local Government Level in Bandung City, Indonesia   	Tutik Rachmawati, Kusuma Dwi Fitriyanti	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/58966/pdf	This research aims to analyze aspects affecting the implementation of electronic parking, a digital- based public services provision in parking. The concept of digital divide, workforce, regulation, and infrastructure were used to conduct the analysis. This study employed a qualitative research methodology with qualitative data collection techniques through interviews with two officers of the Parking Technical Implementation Unit (TIU) - the Department of Transportation Bandung City Government, 4 parking attendants, and 100 people as the roadside parking users. To enrich the data, observation and study documents were also conducted. The research used a descriptive analysis combined with simple descriptive quantitative data. It is evident from this study that four primary aspects hindered the implementation of the electronic-parking initiative. Those aspects are a large gap in the digital divide, low workforce quality and quantity, the absence of the proper regulations, and futile infrastructure. Adding to these four barriers, we also found other significant aspects: the investment that has not been strategically designed, the lack of leadership, and the low quality of education and marketing. All these three additional aspects also contribute to the failure in meeting the objective of the electronic parking initiative. This finding suggests that any new initiatives in public service provision, mainly using ICT, need to be well communicated and consulted with the implementing units. Furthermore, the initiative needs to be complemented with an acceptable set of policies to ensure its sustainability.
  Women and Hoax News Processing on WhatsApp   	Hani Noor Ilahi	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/31865/pdf	The word hoax became popular with the development of technology that has potentially increased the circulation of hoax news. One of the ways hoax news circulates is through mobile instant messaging applications like WhatsApp, where users can interact directly, or between individuals who are members of a group. In Indonesia, by 2017, WhatsApp was the most used and the longestused mobile instant messaging application, having 35.87 million users. This study focuses on women using WhatsApp, as previous studies have shown that women dominate social media use in Indonesia. Using the elaboration likelihood model, this study aimed to investigate how women process hoax messages about child abduction on WhatsApp. The results of research through interviews and surveys indicate that women tend to process hoax messages about the abduction of children through peripheral lines. The lack of media literacy and the tendency to prioritize the emotional aspects of a story make some women vulnerable to spreading hoaxes through WhatsApp. In this study, the researchers recommend a digital empowerment movement to improve women’s media literacy through an online lecture model on WhatsApp. This program should be professionally managed by experts or academics from relevant fields of study.
  Bridging Indonesia’s Digital Divide: Rural-Urban Linkages?   	Aulia Hadi	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/31835/pdf	While Indonesia is recorded as one of the greatest social media republics in the world, the gap of rural-urban internet access remains a great challenge. As reported in the 2016 Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Indicators, the number of households with internet access in rural areas is nearly half of those in urban areas; 26.3% and 48.5% in a consecutive way. Rather than simply seeing the internet as a medium, this paper discusses the internet as material culture; therefore, it goes beyond the access and focuses on the ways people use the internet to define their culture. From this perspective, this paper draws the two levels of the digital divide of Indonesian rural-urban dwellers. Lack of motivation and limited material access due to social inequality is at the very base of the digital divide. Subsequently, digital skills and usage deepen the digital divide. While splitting people into either rural or urban categories often produces misleading policies, this paper proposes the rural-urban linkages to bridge the digital divide in Indonesia. The rural-urban linkages particularly incorporate the flow of people and information across space as well as the interconnection between sectors, such as agriculture and service.
  Utilization of Big Data Analysis Through Public Video, Virus Data Cooperation, and Social Media as the Surveillance to COVID-19 in Indonesia   	Achmad Maulana Sirojjudin	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/56491/pdf	This article discusses Big Data's use as a surveillance tool for the spread of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), both in Indonesia and the world. In Indonesia, the range of COVID-19 is increasingly sporadic, causing mass panic and Indonesia's geographical characteristics, which will be difficult when this spread could not control quickly. Researchers are conducting several studies to overcome this pandemic, including supervision, features, handling, mobility, patient interaction, treatment evaluation, and the biological structure. These studies become data and lead to Big Data. This article explores how to use Big Data analysis to monitor the spread of COVID-19 as a communication process that reflects mediated communication as a form of mobility and spatial relationships in communication practices. The method used in this article is a literature review and uses meta-synthesis techniques as its analysis. The literature sources used are articles in highly reputable international journals. Based on the reports, various ways to monitor the virus's spread, through public video data, GPS, and social media tracking, trace the patient's movement. Big Data can also provide data collaboration for viruses and pathogens for further research as digital mediated communication is anchored by the diversity of places and the mobility of people, data, and objects.
  Menakar Peran Relawan Politik Pasca Kontestasi Presidensial 2014   	Bambang Arianto	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/18000/11623	This article explains that the role of post-conflict political volunteers in 2004, who began with the presidential activity mapping and projection of the volunteers. It was to find out the tactical steps taken by the political volunteers, especially in issues of politics and government. This study revealed that volunteers more engaged in social media, then divides typology into a community volunteer and non-volunteer community. Form the two typology of volunteers turned out more volunters who choose passivity rather than active.

  A Study on Digital Democracy Practice: Opportunities and Challenges of e-Health Implementation in Indonesia   	Bevaola Kusumasari, Widodo Agus Setianto, Li Li Pang	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/28863/pdf	As a developing country, Indonesia faces a crucial issue concerning the provision of health services to the public. The 1998 political reform led to demands for more aspiring and accommodating bureaucratic services being aﬀorded to the public. The political reform brought about bureaucratic reform bearing good governance, wherein one of its forms is the provision of health services through the innovation of an information technology (IT) based service named e-Health. Keeping in mind Indonesia’s characteristics as a developing country, the implementation of IT-based services evokes numerous debates. This study aims to analyze the implementation of e-Health along with the opportunities it has, and the challenges it faces. By using a study case approach on the Surabaya Municipality Health Authority as the initiator and implementer of e-Health, as well as observations and user surveys, the results show that in spite of having been prepared properly with supporting policies, infrastructure, budgeting, dissemination, and operational system, there were still many prevalent obstacles encountered, particularly concerning digital divide, technical diﬃculties, psychological barriers, and cultural issues. Nevertheless, there are numerous opportunities available for refining e-Health implementation, provided there is a political will from the government to improve and enhance the ICT infrastructure, widespread use of mobile devices, involvement of public participation, and equal distribution of service points easily accessible to the public. Strong government commitment also serves as a guarantee for e-Health service program sustainability in Surabaya Municipality.

To some extent, the effect of globalization will also generate hybrid culture between the sense of being Chinese and adopted local identities.

  Transformasi Pers Islam di Era Reformasi   	Budi Irawanto	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/25371/16241	"The 1998 Reformasi movement has contributed to the blossoming of pers freedom in Indonesia. Consequently, there has been a rapid growth in the number of print media, including the ""Islamic press"" which claims to represent the interest of the muslim majority. In fact, the Islamic press attracts a diverse readership with a wide variety of demographics such as age, gender, social group and ideology.

  Kontestasi Kekuasaan dan Keteladanan Semu di Indonesia   	Michael HB Raditya	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/10853/pdf	Kepemimpinan di Indonesia merupakan persoalan yang menarik untuk ditelaah. Jika bertolak dari tataran diakronis, secara kronologis Indonesia telah mengalami pelbagai macam fase kepemimpinan dan rezim. Ihwal ini dapat menjadi stimulan positif jika masyarakat dapat mengartikulasikan pengalaman bernegaranya dengan tepat. Kontestasi kekuasaan pun tidak dapat terhindarkan, terlebih setiap pemimpin melakukan persaingan dalam memperebutkan kekuasaan. Kontestasi ini tidak hanya merujuk pada tingkat lokal, namun hingga tingkat nasional. Berbagai aspek pun turut menjadi faktor utama dari kontestasi tersebut, seperti tipe kepemimpinan aristokrasi dan demokrasi, hingga perbedaan gender pemimpinnya. Ihwal tersebut turut mengejewantah kan bahwa keteladanan yang didasarkan atas beberapa kontekstual, bersifat pseudo, atau semu. Dalam mengupas ihwal tersebut, telaah yang digunakan merujuk pada pemahaman Barkerakan agen, dan Gramsci akan hegemoni. Tidak hanya itu, Kouzes dan Posner digunakan untuk menilik parameter keteladanan. Asumsi penulis, keteladanan merupakan unsur yang tercipta untuk menghegomoni agen di dalamnya. Bertolak dari mempertanyakan keteladanan, maka pembahasan akan lebih mempertimbangkan aspek agen, hegemoni dan kuasa. Penulis menyadari bahwa tidak mungkin meneliti semua pola kepemimpinan yang ada di Indonesia, maka rujukan contoh kepemimpinan didasarkan pada beberapa contoh di era kolonial, orde lama, orde baru,dan pemerintahan kini. Penelitian ini mencoba untuk mengupas persoalan keteladanan dalam kepemimpinan yang kerap diunggulkan kepemimpinan yang ada di Indonesia.

  (Demokrasi: Problema dan Manfaatnya) Terorisme dan Demokrasi: Masalah Global, Solusi Lokal   	Gabriel Lele	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/11040/8281	Terrorism has become a real challenge to democracy. Despite all the costs it brings, however, measures to handle terrorism until the very recent times are less effective. Defensive measures are sometimes oversupplied while more aggressive ones are undersupplied. Both measures fail to reveal the very essential question of terrorism. Therefore, there needs to be an alternative way of looking at terrorism. Here, terrorism can be captured as an institutional problem at both national and international level. In this stance, terrorism can be put into democracy discourse where democracy is assumed to provide both incentive and constraint to terrorism. In such framework, democratic consolidation is urgently accomplished for terrorism to be eliminated from the society. Such measure is much more reliable and sustainable as it attacks the central question of terrorism in three areas concomitantly: institutional, behavioral, and performance aspects. Once these three aspects are realized, democracy will be the only game in town which consequently can eliminate terrorism.

  Reformasi Konstitusi Dalam Transisi Menuju Demokrasi   	Cornelis Lay, Amalinda Savirani	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/11123/8364	"Constitutional reform is one of the most important ways undertaken by some transitional regime to establish a democratic government. This kind of reform has many models. In Spain i t is called reforma pactada-ruptura pactada involving ""negotiation"" among elite, and a ""rupture"" from the previous regime whose legacy cannot be maintained any longer. The similar model, with different stressing, also took place in Taiwan. As Indonesia is now facing its critical moment in managing political transition following a thirty-two-year authoritarian regime of New Order, a comparative study is valuable in giving inspiration on what route should be pondered. One important political decision to be taken is to reform the constitution, namely the UUD 45. Since its broad and open-to-interpretation character and its executive-heavy, the constitution is easily manipulated Yet, the constitutional reform idea has been critical as it is suspiced by certain groups with its concern on the total changing of the law, and also because the law has been merely a sacred text which left no chance to be reformed. This article suggests that the constitutional reform is possible, it is even a must, as long it is still in the path of the preambule as other country cases had shown how significant the constitutional reform for the process of democratization."

Howeuer, mainstream studies on such issues were influenced, foremost, by political economy approaches and classic liberalism. Thus, mainstream studies pay less attentions on decontruct both the idea of democrary and welfare and tend to essensialize democracy and welfare. lt also insulate politics from conflict and social antagonisms. Rather than analysing pattern of linkages betwoeen welfare and democracy, this study inquire about 'welfare' itself –as common goods– is empty/floating signifier and then put emphasis on welfare –as articulatory social practices and discursiae reality– always been produced, presented and represented in and through political process or battle for hegemony. Moreover, whilst this study underline the primacy of political and discursive social practices, it strongly differ from model of deliberative democracy (liberal pluralist) since it re-emphasize agonistic model of democracy, that was introduced by post-marxist or radical pluralist thinkers. Last of all, agonistic model of democracy deem conflict, undecidability and social antagonism as virtue of democracy and main of political life.

  NGO, Civil Society dan Demokrasi: Kritik atas Pandangan Liberal   	- Suharko	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/11072/8313	By reviewing a variety of studies and research concerning impacts of NGO (Non-Governmental Organizations) activities on civil society empowerment and democracy, the article is a critique of the liberal argument on NGO, civil society and democracy which sees them as having linear and causal relations. On the contrary, it argues that the relationships are much more complex, i.e. involving diverse context and setting. For example, as discussed thoroughly by the author, a number of studies reviewed here confirm that an empowered civil society does not consequentially lead to a consolidated democracy as promoted by the Liberals. Actively operated NGOs â€“as exemplified by the Philippines case in the articleâ€” do not necessarily indicate an active civil society nor an accountable state. In fact, as studies also showed, NGOs would lessen the state capacity in cases where it depends too much to foreign aid.

This paper will analyze various factors which cause such phenomena and predict the Islamic parties position on 2014 election.

Moreover, the involvement of Islamic parties in Indonesian politics has not able to solve the real problems within the society, such as poverty, unemployment, corruption, etc. Unfortunately, the public opinion and education characters in Indonesia also don’t support the Islamic political parties position.

Benturan Antarnegara Demokrasi dan Masa Depan Politik Dunia   	Mohamad Rosyidin	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/13137/9372	'The clash of civilizations' of Samuel Huntington and 'the end of history' of Francis Fukuyama are two grand theories that have been widely accepted as the most dominant narratives in post-Cold War international relations. Unfortunately, there have been little theoretical developments in today's world to predict the future of international conflict. The theory assumed that the furture international conflict will not occur between democracies and non-democracies as Democratic Peace Theory proposed, but between established democracies and emerging democracies. The established democracies reluctant to share their power with the emerging democracies on how to manage global order. This reluctancy will lead to political frictions and conflicts among them. In spite of its theoretical breakthrough, this theory suffers of logical inconsistency since it does not distinguish between emerging democracies and emerging powers. Instead of conflict among democracies, this article argues that international conflict in the 21st century will be dominated by asimetrical conflict between nation-states and radical movements, conflict due to information openess, and conflict over natural resources.

  (Demokrasi: Problema dan Manfaatnya) Civil Society: Pembangun dan Sekaligus Perusak Demokrasi   	Bob Sugeng Hadiwinata	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/11037/8278	"Disillusions with the limits of parliamentary politics and the increasingly dilapidated processes of party politics have generated a renewed interest on civil society as a means of rejuvenating public life. In light of mounting animosity against the ""high politics"" of political parties, parliament, and constitution, civil society is perceived as the diagnosis as well as cure for current ills in politics. This led to glorification of civil society as an alternative to conventional practice of politics. However, experience from new democracies suggests that civil society has been increasingly tampered with cranks, extremists, rejectionists, and crooks. This paper attempts to present two faces of civil society: civil and uncivil; and tries to relate them to democratization. Drawing on Indonesian experience, it argues that civil society can be both supportive and destructive to democracy."

The situation constitutes authoritarianism, cronyism, and corruption. To break the impasse, the decentralized system is proposed to make people closer to the public policy making. Decentralization is also convinced to be the solution to create a good governance. But a number of facts in the developing countries demonstrates that decentralization indeed has ignite emerges backfires such as decentralized corruption, parochialism, horizontal conflict, local political instability and others. This article elaborates the theoretical framework on decentralization's ouput as the a double-edge knife. In a simple words, the concept of decentralization does not have a permanent relationship with the creation of good governance and development.

  Democratic Transition in Local Indonesia: An Overview of Ten Years Democracy   	Cornelis Lay	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/10915/8156	"This article attempts to map out the current situation of democracy in Indonesia, especially at local levels. This map is based on a simple question: the extent to which 10 years of the democratization process in Indonesia has led the country closer towards effective democratic governance. It concludes that an effective democratic government is far from being realized. Moreover, this article shows a paradox in the development of local politics in Indonesia, on the one hand there has been political liberalization which is assumed as a prerequisite for the realization of democratic governance, but on the other hand, the development of local democracy in Indonesia seemed to stop at its infancy stage. The reasons behind this failure are vary, but in principle related to the symptoms that some scientists called as a ""broken linkage"" a syndrome in which the forces of modern intermediary fails to perform its functions in linking demos with public affairs."

  Does Democracy Reduce Corruption in Indonesia?   	Azwar Azwar, Achmat Subekan	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/56886/pdf	This study aims to analyze the long and short-run impact of democracy on corruption in Indonesia. This study used the method of Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and dynamic Error Correction Model (ECM) technique during the year of 1995-2020 with secondary data from The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), The Global Economy and World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI), and Transparency International. The results of the study indicated that democracy has significant effects on the level of corruption only in the long run. In the long run, the results show that the impact of democracy is significant at a 1% significance level and decreases the amount of corruption in Indonesia. A 1% change in democracy and other factors are considered equal, which will change the corruption level by approximately 0.2%. The results imply that political stability associated with democracy will result in the corruption index. In other words, the results suggest that democracy reduces corruption. From a policy point of view, this means that developing democratic institutions should be part of strategies to reduce corruption.
  A Big Battle: The State vs. Indigenous People (Case Study in Jambi Province)   	M. Yusuf, Syafrial Syafrial	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/37568/pdf	The change in designation of Bukit Duabelas area into Bukit Duabelas National Park in Jambi province raises a conflict between the national park official who was ruling the zonation system in the national park and the Orang Rimba people who have lived there for many years. The decision of the protected area aims to preserve the life and culture of Orang Rimba. However, zoning rules in the field are interpreted as an effort to limit space and access to the forest resources for Orang Rimba who have traditionally utilized them. This research uses a case study approach to explore the dynamics of conflict on the protected area. The results of the study show that conflicts in national park management are very dynamic because of shifting disagreement about the protection area. The conflicts began with debates about the zoning system which led into the fight for access to the park resources which were contested over the concept of national parks and customary forests. This paper argues the battle over the national park was not only about contested natural resources but also was a fight for authority and power between the state and indigenous people over the concept of park management.

Secondly, exploring more on own (local and domestic) tradition to find appropriate norms and principles of social justice, i.e. to challenge those of the Western ethical tradition.

Kedua, seharusnya sejak awal kita memfokuskan diplomasikita untuk mencegah agar Australia tidak melakukan tindakan yang merugikan Indonesia. Ketiga, kita harus memahami bangsa dan negara tersebut di segala aspeknya, khususnya dinamika politik domestiknya secara lebih dalam dan lebih kritis lagi
  Government Responsiveness in the Prevention of Spreading Covid-19: Vietnam and Indonesia in Comparison   	M. Yusuf, Ady Muzwardi, Muhammad Syukri	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/56453/pdf	This study attempts to reveal the responsiveness of both Vietnam and Indonesia in anticipating the massive external shock that was Coronavirus-19. A change in external factors, such as pandemics, has challenged politicians and governments at large to be responsive in resolving problems quickly. Generally, recent research focused on reactive policies, disaster mitigation, and medical issues, while discussing government responsiveness in disease prevention is only covered in a few studies. This research uses a comparative qualitative method with an analysis period from December 2019 to the end of May 2020. The data is derived from various secondary information sources, such as research results, news, official reports, or government statements, which are interpreted through a systematic coding process to explain the phenomenon. The primary results showed that government responsiveness determines the success of handling the deadly coronavirus in pre-pandemic and current pandemic situations. A strong political will and leadership style is essential, and a solid bureaucratic apparatus in implementing policies and programs is decisive. As an authoritarian democracy, in collaboration with CDC, Vietnam was able to anticipate before the pandemic spread and succeeded in suppressing the spread after it was detected even though it had issued a blundering policy. Meanwhile, as a democratic country, Indonesia slowly responded to the outbreak by decision making where the pandemic is handled after it is detected and spread to various regions. The rulers tend to avoid the experts and growing opinions addressed to the government.

  The Comparison of Jokowi and Prabowo Subianto Exposed on YouTube   	Redi Panuju	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/33172/pdf	This article reviews the exposure ratio of Jokowi and Prabowo in the YouTube channel. Joko Widodo’s alias, Jokowi, is the President of the Republic of Indonesia 2014-2019. He will re-join the 2019 presidential election, while Prabowo Subianto is a challenger who is supported by the Gerindra Party and the Prosperous Prosperity Party. The analytical method uses the semiotic concept of Strauss and John Fiske, who view the video as a sign system. The sign system is parsed through five political codes: lifestyle, transfer of power, existence, ideology and vision. This study finds that, in general, Jokowi's videos were more visited and preferred than Prabowo's videos, but Prabowo excelled in the transfer code of power, existence and ideology. In the video, Jokowi tends to impress himself as a person who has several characters. As the President of Indonesia, Jokowi displays a diligent character. As a political activist, Jokowi reinforces his ideology as a nationalist. As a citizen, Jokowi imitates the figure who adheres to the values of tradition As a man, Jokowi impressed himself as a humanist.

Prabowo tends to show his affiliation to the right Islamists. The contestation of the 2019 presidential election followed by Jokowi and Prabowo will show the battle of two different sources of legitimacy.

  Menimbang Media Sosial dalam Marketing Politik di Indonesia: Belajar dari Jokowi-Ahok di Pilkada DKI Jakarta 2012   	Wisnu Prasetya Utomo	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/10894/8135	The victory of Jokowi and Basuki Tjahaya Purnama (Ahok) in the 2012 Jakarta election has marked an important stage in the development of political marketing on contemporary Indonesian politics.

  Partisanship in Crisis: Public Response to Covid-19 Pandemic in Indonesia   	Arya Budi, Warih Aji Pamungkas	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/56443/pdf	Given the fact that in a context of crises, people are concerned with their safety, among other things, partisan response toward policies and public leaders is an intriguing topic. This article examines the extent to which partisanship pertains to the time of the Covid-19 pandemic. We employ natural language processing (NLP) and social network analysis (SNA) on Twitter data to analyse public responses toward prominent political leaders, namely, Indonesian President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) and Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan (Anies), in handling the crisis of the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia. We then put the social media analysis in a framework of political partisanship. Our sentiment analysis through NLP across time and categories found that supports and demands towards the two public figures indicate positive and negative partisanship that replicates previous electoral supports. Similarly, our SNA indicates a high polarization rate among the accounts connected with the two leaders in response to the crisis. Extended analysis of the accounts who are at the epicentres of the sentiment conversations, either positive or negative about Jokowi and Anies, reveals that there are connections with their past political support. Though we find negative partisan responses for both leaders, a type of hard-core partisanship has been leveraged for Jokowi but not for Anies. We conclude that electoral polarization contributes to the extent to which partisanship responses circulate in a context of crisis.
  Political Polarization and Selective Exposure of Social Media Users in Indonesia   	Denny Januar Ali, Eriyanto Eriyanto	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/58199/pdf	This study is intended to answer the question of how political polarization is related to social media users’ posts about Covid-19. The researchers chose health cases related to Covid-19 instead of political issues (e.g. elections) to prove that this political polarization has spread to many areas. The research also wants to see the relationship between this political polarization and selective exposure. Theories applied in this study are polarization, filter bubble, and selective exposure. The study applied two methods: social media network analysis and content analysis. The network analysis included 82,156 posts, while the content analysis was carried out on 4,050 social media accounts. The research outcome proves the occurrence of political polarization. Social media users were divided into two major groups, namely pro-Jokowi and anti-Jokowi. Each group interacted with fellow users who had the same political choices and shared the same message content. Users with certain political choices tend to receive the same information as their political choices, and ignore information from other political parties. Another interesting finding from this study is how this polarization was sharpened by the use of hashtags. Each party (supporters and oppositions of Jokowi) uses hashtags to create solidarity and mobilization from each supporter. Research also proves the validity of the selective exposure and filter bubble hypothesis in the Indonesian context.
  Sustainable Administrative Reform Movements Policy in Joko Widodo's Administration   	Yogi Suprayogi Sugandi	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/24784/16028	Joko Widodo (Jokowi) is a leader that is widely expected to transform Indonesia into a better country. Hopes and wishes were rising when he was elected as the president of Indonesia. This paper will describe various innovations undertaken before and after his presidential inauguration as well as the assorted innovations made in reforming the administration of his cabinet. As the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo is required to realize the aspirations of the people in freeing the government from corruption, collusion, and nepotism. The management of ministerial and non-ministerial institutions becomes the very first crucial issue undertaken by Joko Widodo. This led to a polemic in regards to reducing or increasing the number of institutions, as the Jokowi administration actually increased the amount. In Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's administration, several policies were made systematically and based on legislations that had been approved by the lagislature. Joko Widodo's administration in more partial in nature. The administrative reform program that is highly anticipated is the continuation of the Public Service Act. This law is a step forward from the administrative reform program that aims at the creation of good governance. Changes is career path, salary system, pension and benefits for civil servants, performance-based staffing are various efforts of sustainability carried out by Joko Widodo's administration.
  Pembentukan Struktur Negosiasi Kota Surakarta: Kritik Nalar ‘Best Practices’ dalam Penyelenggaraan Pemerintahan   	Hendra Try Ardianto	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/11389/8473	"This paper attempts to describe two fundamental ideas about best practices. Firstly, criticism of the notion of ""best practices"" that is very agent-centric. It asserts that the discourse ""best practices"" should not be separated from socio political structures. In the case of Surakarta, the agency perspective that put Jokowi as the center of innovation was apparently failed to understand the overall dynamics of governance practices and tend to be misleading. Secondly, this paper tries to restore the meaning of participation as a form of politicization, not merely procedural- managerial affairs. Thus, participation is not only a mobilization to encourage the dreams of innovation, rather, participation is a matter of negotiation in which the contestation of interests between people, nations, and the market becomes the main case."

The fall of Soeharto in 1998 was also followed by the rise of some groups which enroots their ideology and value with the ideology of Islamic political movement in Middle East.

  Media Sosial dan Revolusi Politik: Memahami Kembali Fenomena “Arab Spring” dalam Perspektif Ruang Publik Transnasional   	Ahmad. R Mardhatillah Umar, Arief Bakhtiar Darmawan, Faela Sufa Sufa, Gebyar Lintang Ndadari	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/13130/9359	This paper aims to analyze some linkages between revolution, public sphere, and transnational activism through social media in the Middle East. A revolution in Tunisia in 2011 became an international issue aft er the revolution spreaded to other states in the region. Aft er Tunisia, protest movements began to ignite in Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Jordania. This wave of revolution comes into a public discourse: what causes this movement? How could a revolution in one country inspire another revolution in another country? To answer these questions, we analyze the role of social media as a “bridge” to connect activists in the Middle East to make a revolution. We conclude that transnational activism was formed by routine and massive reports from media which explained what hadhappened in the Middle East during the revolution. The reports were followed by a spread of the idea of democracy and civil rights through social media. As a consequence, revolution took place in several othercountries whose socio-cultural tradition are similar to that of Tunisia.

Jika kekuatan Negara dan gereja sebagai representasi kekuatan pembangunan dan modernisasi mengalami penurunan peran dalam keseluruhan pembangunan masyarakat.

Alhasil, ketika negara gagal menjadi agen perubahan sosial dan gereja menemui titik kebuntuan dalam mencangkokan nilai-nilai katolikisme, adat merayakan diri sebagai representasi institusi lokal yang terkuat di Adonara.

This dynamics occurs due to influence from state and free market which got response from Banjar Pakraman community, thus the free market become more dominant. The influence of free market had change public behaviors, thus improve the efficiency and effectiveness of custom activity."
