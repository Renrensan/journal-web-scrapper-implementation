 The Comparison of Jokowi and Prabowo Subianto Exposed on YouTube   	Redi Panuju	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/33172/pdf	This article reviews the exposure ratio of Jokowi and Prabowo in the YouTube channel. Joko Widodo’s alias, Jokowi, is the President of the Republic of Indonesia 2014-2019. He will re-join the 2019 presidential election, while Prabowo Subianto is a challenger who is supported by the Gerindra Party and the Prosperous Prosperity Party. The analytical method uses the semiotic concept of Strauss and John Fiske, who view the video as a sign system. The sign system is parsed through five political codes: lifestyle, transfer of power, existence, ideology and vision. This study finds that, in general, Jokowi's videos were more visited and preferred than Prabowo's videos, but Prabowo excelled in the transfer code of power, existence and ideology. In the video, Jokowi tends to impress himself as a person who has several characters. As the President of Indonesia, Jokowi displays a diligent character. As a political activist, Jokowi reinforces his ideology as a nationalist. As a citizen, Jokowi imitates the figure who adheres to the values of tradition As a man, Jokowi impressed himself as a humanist. Prabowo tends to feature a lavish lifestyle with equestrian sport with a historical background of the descendants of an economic Democrat Prof Sumitro Djojohadikusumo and associates himself like Soekarno. Prabowo tends to show his affiliation to the right Islamists. The contestation of the 2019 presidential election followed by Jokowi and Prabowo will show the battle of two different sources of legitimacy.

 Menimbang Media Sosial dalam Marketing Politik di Indonesia: Belajar dari Jokowi-Ahok di Pilkada DKI Jakarta 2012   	Wisnu Prasetya Utomo	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/10894/8135	The victory of Jokowi and Basuki Tjahaya Purnama (Ahok) in the 2012 Jakarta election has marked an important stage in the development of political marketing on contemporary Indonesian politics. Social media provides a great influence in this election. Social media became an effective tools to organize people and mobilize voters.

 Partisanship in Crisis: Public Response to Covid-19 Pandemic in Indonesia   	Arya Budi, Warih Aji Pamungkas	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/56443/pdf	Given the fact that in a context of crises, people are concerned with their safety, among other things, partisan response toward policies and public leaders is an intriguing topic. This article examines the extent to which partisanship pertains to the time of the Covid-19 pandemic. We employ natural language processing (NLP) and social network analysis (SNA) on Twitter data to analyse public responses toward prominent political leaders, namely, Indonesian President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) and Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan (Anies), in handling the crisis of the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia. We then put the social media analysis in a framework of political partisanship. Our sentiment analysis through NLP across time and categories found that supports and demands towards the two public figures indicate positive and negative partisanship that replicates previous electoral supports. Similarly, our SNA indicates a high polarization rate among the accounts connected with the two leaders in response to the crisis. Extended analysis of the accounts who are at the epicentres of the sentiment conversations, either positive or negative about Jokowi and Anies, reveals that there are connections with their past political support. Though we find negative partisan responses for both leaders, a type of hard-core partisanship has been leveraged for Jokowi but not for Anies. We conclude that electoral polarization contributes to the extent to which partisanship responses circulate in a context of crisis.
 Sustainable Administrative Reform Movements Policy in Joko Widodo's Administration   	Yogi Suprayogi Sugandi	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/24784/16028	Joko Widodo (Jokowi) is a leader that is widely expected to transform Indonesia into a better country. Hopes and wishes were rising when he was elected as the president of Indonesia. This paper will describe various innovations undertaken before and after his presidential inauguration as well as the assorted innovations made in reforming the administration of his cabinet. As the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo is required to realize the aspirations of the people in freeing the government from corruption, collusion, and nepotism. The management of ministerial and non-ministerial institutions becomes the very first crucial issue undertaken by Joko Widodo. This led to a polemic in regards to reducing or increasing the number of institutions, as the Jokowi administration actually increased the amount. In Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's administration, several policies were made systematically and based on legislations that had been approved by the lagislature. Joko Widodo's administration in more partial in nature. The administrative reform program that is highly anticipated is the continuation of the Public Service Act. This law is a step forward from the administrative reform program that aims at the creation of good governance. Changes is career path, salary system, pension and benefits for civil servants, performance-based staffing are various efforts of sustainability carried out by Joko Widodo's administration.
 Political Polarization and Selective Exposure of Social Media Users in Indonesia   	Denny Januar Ali, Eriyanto Eriyanto	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/58199/pdf	This study is intended to answer the question of how political polarization is related to social media users’ posts about Covid-19. The researchers chose health cases related to Covid-19 instead of political issues (e.g. elections) to prove that this political polarization has spread to many areas. The research also wants to see the relationship between this political polarization and selective exposure. Theories applied in this study are polarization, filter bubble, and selective exposure. The study applied two methods: social media network analysis and content analysis. The network analysis included 82,156 posts, while the content analysis was carried out on 4,050 social media accounts. The research outcome proves the occurrence of political polarization. Social media users were divided into two major groups, namely pro-Jokowi and anti-Jokowi. Each group interacted with fellow users who had the same political choices and shared the same message content. Users with certain political choices tend to receive the same information as their political choices, and ignore information from other political parties. Another interesting finding from this study is how this polarization was sharpened by the use of hashtags. Each party (supporters and oppositions of Jokowi) uses hashtags to create solidarity and mobilization from each supporter. Research also proves the validity of the selective exposure and filter bubble hypothesis in the Indonesian context.
 Pembentukan Struktur Negosiasi Kota Surakarta: Kritik Nalar ‘Best Practices’ dalam Penyelenggaraan Pemerintahan   	Hendra Try Ardianto	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/11389/8473	"This paper attempts to describe two fundamental ideas about best practices. Firstly, criticism of the notion of ""best practices"" that is very agent-centric. It asserts that the discourse ""best practices"" should not be separated from socio political structures. In the case of Surakarta, the agency perspective that put Jokowi as the center of innovation was apparently failed to understand the overall dynamics of governance practices and tend to be misleading. Secondly, this paper tries to restore the meaning of participation as a form of politicization, not merely procedural- managerial affairs. Thus, participation is not only a mobilization to encourage the dreams of innovation, rather, participation is a matter of negotiation in which the contestation of interests between people, nations, and the market becomes the main case."

 A Big Battle: The State vs. Indigenous People (Case Study in Jambi Province)   	M. Yusuf, Syafrial Syafrial	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/37568/pdf	The change in designation of Bukit Duabelas area into Bukit Duabelas National Park in Jambi province raises a conflict between the national park official who was ruling the zonation system in the national park and the Orang Rimba people who have lived there for many years. The decision of the protected area aims to preserve the life and culture of Orang Rimba. However, zoning rules in the field are interpreted as an effort to limit space and access to the forest resources for Orang Rimba who have traditionally utilized them. This research uses a case study approach to explore the dynamics of conflict on the protected area. The results of the study show that conflicts in national park management are very dynamic because of shifting disagreement about the protection area. The conflicts began with debates about the zoning system which led into the fight for access to the park resources which were contested over the concept of national parks and customary forests. This paper argues the battle over the national park was not only about contested natural resources but also was a fight for authority and power between the state and indigenous people over the concept of park management.

Jika kekuatan Negara dan gereja sebagai representasi kekuatan pembangunan dan modernisasi mengalami penurunan peran dalam keseluruhan pembangunan masyarakat. Sebaliknya, adat sebagai representasi kekuatan lokal justru menunjukkan hegemoninya di hampir seluruh aspek kehidupan masyarakat. Bangkitnya adat sebagai kekuatan hegemonik tersebut tidak dapat dilepaskan dari desain kebijakan desentralisasi dan otonomi daerah yang memberikan ruang kebebasan bagi ekspresi lokal untuk menegaskan identitasnya. Alhasil, ketika negara gagal menjadi agen perubahan sosial dan gereja menemui titik kebuntuan dalam mencangkokan nilai-nilai katolikisme, adat merayakan diri sebagai representasi institusi lokal yang terkuat di Adonara.

Secara garis besar aspek amity (kerjasama) antara kedua negara jauh lebih dominan dari pada aspek enmity-nya (permusuhan).

The result suggests that community of Banjar Pakraman Batannyuh has a welfare system which was practiced since long time ago. This system is based on Menyama Braya and Suka Duka values, its institutions form of Keliran, Dadia and Sekehe besides through mechanisms of mutual cooperation, arisan, contribution and giving each other. The main principle of this system is even redistribution and balance without differentiating economic status of community, thus it is not pro poor. When public condition is homogenous, this system is effective to bring public welfare into reality. Whereas, with the heterogeneity in community and high discrepancy due to market system inducing makes this system become not effective. Even this system burdens public.

On the other hand, state welfare system also reaches the community life of Banjar Pakraman. This system which derived from state is not replacing welfare system of Banjar Pakraman, but there is a variation on relation patterns, it is depend on the policy. In general, subsidy policy for poor community is ineffective, thus people makes an even redistribution according to main principle of Banjar Pakraman welfare system.

The dynamics of public welfare system in Banjar Pakraman is phenomenon of social changing. This dynamics occurs due to influence from state and free market which got response from Banjar Pakraman community, thus the free market become more dominant. The influence of free market had change public behaviors, thus improve the efficiency and effectiveness of custom activity."

This paper will analyze various factors which cause such phenomena and predict the Islamic parties position on 2014 election. The result found that Islamic parties will face tough position on next election because of democracy, Indonesian Islamic characteristics and history, the competence of Islamic parties, and other external factors. The democracy causes a lot of problems, like the conflict among Islamic groups in Indonesia, which had dark history as the consequence of the politization of Islam by the elites. Moreover, the involvement of Islamic parties in Indonesian politics has not able to solve the real problems within the society, such as poverty, unemployment, corruption, etc. Unfortunately, the public opinion and education characters in Indonesia also don’t support the Islamic political parties position.
