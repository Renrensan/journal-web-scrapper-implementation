  The Comparison of Jokowi and Prabowo Subianto Exposed on YouTube   	Redi Panuju	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/33172/pdf	This article reviews the exposure ratio of Jokowi and Prabowo in the YouTube channel. Joko Widodo’s alias, Jokowi, is the President of the Republic of Indonesia 2014-2019. He will re-join the 2019 presidential election, while Prabowo Subianto is a challenger who is supported by the Gerindra Party and the Prosperous Prosperity Party. The analytical method uses the semiotic concept of Strauss and John Fiske, who view the video as a sign system. The sign system is parsed through five political codes: lifestyle, transfer of power, existence, ideology and vision. This study finds that, in general, Jokowi's videos were more visited and preferred than Prabowo's videos, but Prabowo excelled in the transfer code of power, existence and ideology. In the video, Jokowi tends to impress himself as a person who has several characters. As the President of Indonesia, Jokowi displays a diligent character. As a political activist, Jokowi reinforces his ideology as a nationalist. As a citizen, Jokowi imitates the figure who adheres to the values of tradition As a man, Jokowi impressed himself as a humanist. Prabowo tends to feature a lavish lifestyle with equestrian sport with a historical background of the descendants of an economic Democrat Prof Sumitro Djojohadikusumo and associates himself like Soekarno. Prabowo tends to show his affiliation to the right Islamists. The contestation of the 2019 presidential election followed by Jokowi and Prabowo will show the battle of two different sources of legitimacy.

  Menimbang Media Sosial dalam Marketing Politik di Indonesia: Belajar dari Jokowi-Ahok di Pilkada DKI Jakarta 2012   	Wisnu Prasetya Utomo	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/10894/8135	The victory of Jokowi and Basuki Tjahaya Purnama (Ahok) in the 2012 Jakarta election has marked an important stage in the development of political marketing on contemporary Indonesian politics. Social media provides a great influence in this election. Social media became an effective tools to organize people and mobilize voters. In the era of political personalization after the authoritarian New Order, mix-mediated political marketing which combine social media, mass media, and traditional political marketing can be an alternative strategy for the candidate or political party to win the election.
  Partisanship in Crisis: Public Response to Covid-19 Pandemic in Indonesia   	Arya Budi, Warih Aji Pamungkas	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/56443/pdf	Given the fact that in a context of crises, people are concerned with their safety, among other things, partisan response toward policies and public leaders is an intriguing topic. This article examines the extent to which partisanship pertains to the time of the Covid-19 pandemic. We employ natural language processing (NLP) and social network analysis (SNA) on Twitter data to analyse public responses toward prominent political leaders, namely, Indonesian President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) and Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan (Anies), in handling the crisis of the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia. We then put the social media analysis in a framework of political partisanship. Our sentiment analysis through NLP across time and categories found that supports and demands towards the two public figures indicate positive and negative partisanship that replicates previous electoral supports. Similarly, our SNA indicates a high polarization rate among the accounts connected with the two leaders in response to the crisis. Extended analysis of the accounts who are at the epicentres of the sentiment conversations, either positive or negative about Jokowi and Anies, reveals that there are connections with their past political support. Though we find negative partisan responses for both leaders, a type of hard-core partisanship has been leveraged for Jokowi but not for Anies. We conclude that electoral polarization contributes to the extent to which partisanship responses circulate in a context of crisis.
  Political Polarization and Selective Exposure of Social Media Users in Indonesia   	Denny Januar Ali, Eriyanto Eriyanto	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/58199/pdf	This study is intended to answer the question of how political polarization is related to social media users’ posts about Covid-19. The researchers chose health cases related to Covid-19 instead of political issues (e.g. elections) to prove that this political polarization has spread to many areas. The research also wants to see the relationship between this political polarization and selective exposure. Theories applied in this study are polarization, filter bubble, and selective exposure. The study applied two methods: social media network analysis and content analysis. The network analysis included 82,156 posts, while the content analysis was carried out on 4,050 social media accounts. The research outcome proves the occurrence of political polarization. Social media users were divided into two major groups, namely pro-Jokowi and anti-Jokowi. Each group interacted with fellow users who had the same political choices and shared the same message content. Users with certain political choices tend to receive the same information as their political choices, and ignore information from other political parties. Another interesting finding from this study is how this polarization was sharpened by the use of hashtags. Each party (supporters and oppositions of Jokowi) uses hashtags to create solidarity and mobilization from each supporter. Research also proves the validity of the selective exposure and filter bubble hypothesis in the Indonesian context.

Hopes and wishes were rising when he was elected as the president of Indonesia. This paper will describe various innovations undertaken before and after his presidential inauguration as well as the assorted innovations made in reforming the administration of his cabinet.

Joko Widodo's administration in more partial in nature. The administrative reform program that is highly anticipated is the continuation of the Public Service Act. This law is a step forward from the administrative reform program that aims at the creation of good governance. Changes is career path, salary system, pension and benefits for civil servants, performance-based staffing are various efforts of sustainability carried out by Joko Widodo's administration.

  Pembentukan Struktur Negosiasi Kota Surakarta: Kritik Nalar ‘Best Practices’ dalam Penyelenggaraan Pemerintahan   	Hendra Try Ardianto	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/11389/8473	"This paper attempts to describe two fundamental ideas about best practices. Firstly, criticism of the notion of ""best practices"" that is very agent-centric. It asserts that the discourse ""best practices"" should not be separated from socio political structures. In the case of Surakarta, the agency perspective that put Jokowi as the center of innovation was apparently failed to understand the overall dynamics of governance practices and tend to be misleading. Secondly, this paper tries to restore the meaning of participation as a form of politicization, not merely procedural- managerial affairs. Thus, participation is not only a mobilization to encourage the dreams of innovation, rather, participation is a matter of negotiation in which the contestation of interests between people, nations, and the market becomes the main case."

  A Big Battle: The State vs. Indigenous People (Case Study in Jambi Province)   	M. Yusuf, Syafrial Syafrial	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/37568/pdf	The change in designation of Bukit Duabelas area into Bukit Duabelas National Park in Jambi province raises a conflict between the national park official who was ruling the zonation system in the national park and the Orang Rimba people who have lived there for many years. The decision of the protected area aims to preserve the life and culture of Orang Rimba. However, zoning rules in the field are interpreted as an effort to limit space and access to the forest resources for Orang Rimba who have traditionally utilized them. This research uses a case study approach to explore the dynamics of conflict on the protected area. The results of the study show that conflicts in national park management are very dynamic because of shifting disagreement about the protection area. The conflicts began with debates about the zoning system which led into the fight for access to the park resources which were contested over the concept of national parks and customary forests. This paper argues the battle over the national park was not only about contested natural resources but also was a fight for authority and power between the state and indigenous people over the concept of park management.

While the survey tells us that political setting highly influencial in shaping the movement, the very political nature of the movement is not necessarily lays in women relationship to the state. The jargon is that ""personal is political."" Some movement aims at practical change and other concerns with strategic change. In an attempt to map out the reason, as to why woman movement take place, this article identifies two possible reasons. First, the movement is organised in response to the abusive use of authority. If the movement is not organised in response to authoritarianism it could be taking place in response to the opening of opportunity structure."

  Transformasi Pers Islam di Era Reformasi   	Budi Irawanto	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/25371/16241	"The 1998 Reformasi movement has contributed to the blossoming of pers freedom in Indonesia. Consequently, there has been a rapid growth in the number of print media, including the ""Islamic press"" which claims to represent the interest of the muslim majority. In fact, the Islamic press attracts a diverse readership with a wide variety of demographics such as age, gender, social group and ideology. The growth of the Islamic press is scruntinized in this article to clarify the process of negotiationb between Islamic value, popular culture, mystic traditions and Indonesia contemporary politics. This process of negotiation has become important following the financial bankruptcy of many Islamic media organisations due to mismanagement and changes in the aspirations of Indonesian muslim.

In the midst of the crush of neoliberal labor market flexibility, workers still often performs various street protests. The rising of minimum wage and changes in employment status towards more profitable one, are some workers material benefits gained through their street protest. Moreover, street protest also contributes to the making of collective workers identity. The high intensity of the street actions spawned the backlash from the capital and state. However, this attack rather than weaken the labor movement, instead it has the potential to encourage greater unity needs of the workers. The backlash from the capital and state during growing economic circumstances provide momentum to the emerging needs of modern interest organizations: a labor’ party. The future of the establishment labor’ party will depend on how much effort of the progressive elements in trade union able to leverage on the one hand a growing economy condition, and at the same time politically able to use reprisals of state and capital against their movement to create the need for the formation of an independent labor party for the rank and file workers.

  Melacak Akar Radikalisme Islam di Indonesia   	Ahmad Rizky Mardhatillah Umar	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/10935/8176	Radicalism nowadays becomes a popular discourse in Indonesia. The fall of Soeharto in 1998 was also followed by the rise of some groups which enroots their ideology and value with the ideology of Islamic political movement in Middle East. Many authors even connect this phenomenon to terrorism. By those points of view, they try to encounter terrorism by de-radicalizing people and promoting the empowerment of moderate society. But this point of view is argued by some authors who think that terrorism differs from radicalism. It is structural problem –poverty, oppression, political authoritarianism— which implies violence and terror. It leads us to a question: What cause radicalism? This article attempts to analyze the historical and political-economic root of Radical Islam group in Indonesia.

  (Demokrasi: Problema dan Manfaatnya) Civil Society: Pembangun dan Sekaligus Perusak Demokrasi   	Bob Sugeng Hadiwinata	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/11037/8278	"Disillusions with the limits of parliamentary politics and the increasingly dilapidated processes of party politics have generated a renewed interest on civil society as a means of rejuvenating public life. In light of mounting animosity against the ""high politics"" of political parties, parliament, and constitution, civil society is perceived as the diagnosis as well as cure for current ills in politics. This led to glorification of civil society as an alternative to conventional practice of politics. However, experience from new democracies suggests that civil society has been increasingly tampered with cranks, extremists, rejectionists, and crooks. This paper attempts to present two faces of civil society: civil and uncivil; and tries to relate them to democratization. Drawing on Indonesian experience, it argues that civil society can be both supportive and destructive to democracy."

These sub-domains ofcommunication studies tend to be practical, focusing on practicality rather than concepts. The impact of this on commnunication scholars is an issue that the scholars should have enough knowledge on empirical practice before or while studying the sub-domains of communication studies.

  Kebijakan Politik dan Keamanan Australia di Kawasan Asia Pasifik   	Aleksius Jemadu	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/11016/8257	The main objective of this paper is to explain the evolution of Australia's security and foreign policy in the Asia Pacific region. It is argued that the uniqueness of Australia's position in this region affects both the content and modalities of its security and foreign policy vis a vis its Asian neighbours. Since PM John Howard took power, there has been a more assertive and aggressive approach towards the region as Australia tries to respond the changing environment of its national security policy. Australia's security policy may affect its relationship with the Asian neighbours especially Indonesia in the sense that contention and friction may become a recurrent pattern. Both Australia and Indonesia should be aware of that reality and try to anticipate the consequences by referring to the existing opportunities for good neighbour policy.

  Konﬂik Internasional Abad ke-21? Benturan Antarnegara Demokrasi dan Masa Depan Politik Dunia   	Mohamad Rosyidin	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/13137/9372	'The clash of civilizations' of Samuel Huntington and 'the end of history' of Francis Fukuyama are two grand theories that have been widely accepted as the most dominant narratives in post-Cold War international relations. Unfortunately, there have been little theoretical developments in today's world to predict the future of international conflict. The theory assumed that the furture international conflict will not occur between democracies and non-democracies as Democratic Peace Theory proposed, but between established democracies and emerging democracies. The established democracies reluctant to share their power with the emerging democracies on how to manage global order. This reluctancy will lead to political frictions and conflicts among them. In spite of its theoretical breakthrough, this theory suffers of logical inconsistency since it does not distinguish between emerging democracies and emerging powers. Instead of conflict among democracies, this article argues that international conflict in the 21st century will be dominated by asimetrical conflict between nation-states and radical movements, conflict due to information openess, and conflict over natural resources.

  Reformasi Konstitusi Dalam Transisi Menuju Demokrasi   	Cornelis Lay, Amalinda Savirani	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/11123/8364	"Constitutional reform is one of the most important ways undertaken by some transitional regime to establish a democratic government. This kind of reform has many models. In Spain i t is called reforma pactada-ruptura pactada involving ""negotiation"" among elite, and a ""rupture"" from the previous regime whose legacy cannot be maintained any longer. The similar model, with different stressing, also took place in Taiwan. As Indonesia is now facing its critical moment in managing political transition following a thirty-two-year authoritarian regime of New Order, a comparative study is valuable in giving inspiration on what route should be pondered. One important political decision to be taken is to reform the constitution, namely the UUD 45. Since its broad and open-to-interpretation character and its executive-heavy, the constitution is easily manipulated Yet, the constitutional reform idea has been critical as it is suspiced by certain groups with its concern on the total changing of the law, and also because the law has been merely a sacred text which left no chance to be reformed. This article suggests that the constitutional reform is possible, it is even a must, as long it is still in the path of the preambule as other country cases had shown how significant the constitutional reform for the process of democratization."
  Democratic Transition in Local Indonesia: An Overview of Ten Years Democracy   	Cornelis Lay	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/10915/8156	"This article attempts to map out the current situation of democracy in Indonesia, especially at local levels. This map is based on a simple question: the extent to which 10 years of the democratization process in Indonesia has led the country closer towards effective democratic governance. It concludes that an effective democratic government is far from being realized. Moreover, this article shows a paradox in the development of local politics in Indonesia, on the one hand there has been political liberalization which is assumed as a prerequisite for the realization of democratic governance, but on the other hand, the development of local democracy in Indonesia seemed to stop at its infancy stage. The reasons behind this failure are vary, but in principle related to the symptoms that some scientists called as a ""broken linkage"" a syndrome in which the forces of modern intermediary fails to perform its functions in linking demos with public affairs."

The third character is that the Muslim scholars and activists still have different perceptions on the way Islam contribute and act in the context of the nation politics. Those three characterislics have been the basis of problems and challenges toward Indonesian Islam in the political context.

To answer these questions, we analyze the role of social media as a “bridge” to connect activists in the Middle East to make a revolution. We conclude that transnational activism was formed by routine and massive reports from media which explained what hadhappened in the Middle East during the revolution. The reports were followed by a spread of the idea of democracy and civil rights through social media. As a consequence, revolution took place in several othercountries whose socio-cultural tradition are similar to that of Tunisia.

This article shows that the openness of public information is a prerequisite for political democracy in Malaysia to help the government minimize the mis-management of governance policies, especially in finance and resource management.

Due to welfare is a complex matter, then this study only focused on the fulfillment of public main necessaries in order to specify the discussion.

The result suggests that community of Banjar Pakraman Batannyuh has a welfare system which was practiced since long time ago. This system is based on Menyama Braya and Suka Duka values, its institutions form of Keliran, Dadia and Sekehe besides through mechanisms of mutual cooperation, arisan, contribution and giving each other. The main principle of this system is even redistribution and balance without differentiating economic status of community, thus it is not pro poor. When public condition is homogenous, this system is effective to bring public welfare into reality. Whereas, with the heterogeneity in community and high discrepancy due to market system inducing makes this system become not effective. Even this system burdens public.

On the other hand, state welfare system also reaches the community life of Banjar Pakraman. This system which derived from state is not replacing welfare system of Banjar Pakraman, but there is a variation on relation patterns, it is depend on the policy. In general, subsidy policy for poor community is ineffective, thus people makes an even redistribution according to main principle of Banjar Pakraman welfare system.

The dynamics of public welfare system in Banjar Pakraman is phenomenon of social changing. This dynamics occurs due to influence from state and free market which got response from Banjar Pakraman community, thus the free market become more dominant. The influence of free market had change public behaviors, thus improve the efficiency and effectiveness of custom activity."

This has been remarked by two social paradoxes: (I) global competitions that have expressed in severalhumanity issues (human rights democracy, environment) in front of the existence of national development as political legitimation of the New Order rezim; (2) domestic phenomena; society's struggles in gaining autonomy space in front of centralization of power by the state through various instrumental ways. In this point, the Army has to react those challenges, not only external (toward political, economic, judicial and cultural issues) but also internal ways (self-regulation by scientific understanding and awareness of objectivity on humanity issues).

  (Demokrasi: Problema dan Manfaatnya) Terorisme dan Demokrasi: Masalah Global, Solusi Lokal   	Gabriel Lele	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/11040/8281	Terrorism has become a real challenge to democracy. Despite all the costs it brings, however, measures to handle terrorism until the very recent times are less effective. Defensive measures are sometimes oversupplied while more aggressive ones are undersupplied. Both measures fail to reveal the very essential question of terrorism. Therefore, there needs to be an alternative way of looking at terrorism. Here, terrorism can be captured as an institutional problem at both national and international level. In this stance, terrorism can be put into democracy discourse where democracy is assumed to provide both incentive and constraint to terrorism. In such framework, democratic consolidation is urgently accomplished for terrorism to be eliminated from the society. Such measure is much more reliable and sustainable as it attacks the central question of terrorism in three areas concomitantly: institutional, behavioral, and performance aspects. Once these three aspects are realized, democracy will be the only game in town which consequently can eliminate terrorism.

  NGO, Civil Society dan Demokrasi: Kritik atas Pandangan Liberal   	- Suharko	https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jsp/article/view/11072/8313	By reviewing a variety of studies and research concerning impacts of NGO (Non-Governmental Organizations) activities on civil society empowerment and democracy, the article is a critique of the liberal argument on NGO, civil society and democracy which sees them as having linear and causal relations. On the contrary, it argues that the relationships are much more complex, i.e. involving diverse context and setting. For example, as discussed thoroughly by the author, a number of studies reviewed here confirm that an empowered civil society does not consequentially lead to a consolidated democracy as promoted by the Liberals. Actively operated NGOs â€“as exemplified by the Philippines case in the articleâ€” do not necessarily indicate an active civil society nor an accountable state. In fact, as studies also showed, NGOs would lessen the state capacity in cases where it depends too much to foreign aid.

Jika bertolak dari tataran diakronis, secara kronologis Indonesia telah mengalami pelbagai macam fase kepemimpinan dan rezim. Ihwal ini dapat menjadi stimulan positif jika masyarakat dapat mengartikulasikan pengalaman bernegaranya dengan tepat. Kontestasi kekuasaan pun tidak dapat terhindarkan, terlebih setiap pemimpin melakukan persaingan dalam memperebutkan kekuasaan. Kontestasi ini tidak hanya merujuk pada tingkat lokal, namun hingga tingkat nasional. Berbagai aspek pun turut menjadi faktor utama dari kontestasi tersebut, seperti tipe kepemimpinan aristokrasi dan demokrasi, hingga perbedaan gender pemimpinnya. Ihwal tersebut turut mengejewantah kan bahwa keteladanan yang didasarkan atas beberapa kontekstual, bersifat pseudo, atau semu. Dalam mengupas ihwal tersebut, telaah yang digunakan merujuk pada pemahaman Barkerakan agen, dan Gramsci akan hegemoni. Tidak hanya itu, Kouzes dan Posner digunakan untuk menilik parameter keteladanan. Asumsi penulis, keteladanan merupakan unsur yang tercipta untuk menghegomoni agen di dalamnya. Bertolak dari mempertanyakan keteladanan, maka pembahasan akan lebih mempertimbangkan aspek agen, hegemoni dan kuasa. Penulis menyadari bahwa tidak mungkin meneliti semua pola kepemimpinan yang ada di Indonesia, maka rujukan contoh kepemimpinan didasarkan pada beberapa contoh di era kolonial, orde lama, orde baru,dan pemerintahan kini. Penelitian ini mencoba untuk mengupas persoalan keteladanan dalam kepemimpinan yang kerap diunggulkan kepemimpinan yang ada di Indonesia.
